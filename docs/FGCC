FGCC - Frugal GCC Wrapper Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

fgcc is a wrapper program that will wrap a forth interpreter and the
forth code into a simple C file, which can be compiled by a standard
compliant C compiler, specifically gcc.

fgcc is not a C-to-forth converter, however. Please do not advertise it
as such.

fgcc can generate direct C code, using the -cgen option, or it can
compile an executable directly.

fgcc currently does not create especially space-efficient code, but this
should be remedied shortly.


Usage: fgcc [-o file] [-cgen file.c] [-bare] [-q] sources.fs
       -o file      Output executable filename
       -cgen file   Generate C code - do not compile
       -q           Generate "quiet" code
       -bare        Don't include init.fs
       -norm        Compile a normal interpreter.


-o file      The output executable's filename. If -o is not specified,
             it defaults to a.out

-cgen file   The output C file's filename. This cannot be combined with
             -o. You must either make an executable or a C file, not both.

-cc name     Use name as the C compiler instead of gcc.

-q           Suppress the normal introduction message. Make it "quiet".

-bare        Do not include init.fs. This is primarily useful if you want
             to use your own init.fs, as many standard forth words will not
             be included by default.

-norm        Only include init.fs. This option effectively does nothing,
             but in order to compile, you have to have at least 1 arg
             on the command line. This might as well be it. This is useful
             for compiling your own "normal" interpreter.



Examples:

fgcc blah.fs

Creates an executable named "a.out" that natively includes the forth
code in blah.fs.


fgcc -o blah blah.fs

Same thing as above, except the executable is named "blah".


fgcc -cgen blah.c blah.fs

Creates a C file named "blah.c" that, when compiled, will create an
executable that natively includes the forth code in blah.fs.


fgcc pong.fs -o pong -q

Creates an executable "pong" that when executed, launches frugal's flagship
game, "pong".


fgcc -norm -o frugal

Creates a frugal interpreter that doesn't depend on the file "init.fs"
unlike the normal interpreter.
