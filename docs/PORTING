Frugal Portability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Frugal is written in (relatively portable) ANSI C. It will probably run on
almost all unix systems, and should be portable to windows via cygwin
and whatnot.

It will run on both big and little endian architectures. It will run on
both address-aligned systems and non-address-aligned systems.

If you are running on SPARC, you may have to open up the Makefile and
select the correct CFLAGS variable.

It has sucessfuly been ran on:

OpenBSD/x86 <- Primary development platform
NetBSD/x86
Linux/x86
Linux/macPPC
Linux/mac68k
OS X/macPPC
SunOS/SPARC


Please E-Mail me any other OS's you have been able (or not able) to run
frugal forth on.
