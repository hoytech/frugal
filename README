HardCore SoftWare's FORTH system: Frugal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This program is Copyright 2002 by HardCore Software, and it's
distribution is protected by the GNU General Public License.
See the file COPYING for details.


This is the Frugal Forth environment. Programming and usage is very
similar to most Forth environments.


Configuration: (PROBABLY OPTIONAL)
Edit Makefile and uncomment to appropriate configuration line, according to
your operating system and architecture.

Compilation:
make

Running:
./frugal

You can include files on the command line:
./frugal progs/pong.fs

You can also include files from within the interpreter like so:
include" progs/pong.fs"

Also, you may want to investigate fgcc, a gcc wrapper for frugal forth
code that will let you create native, standalone (except for libc)
applications. Check out docs/FGCC for more details.

See the files in docs/ for more info on programming and implementation.
See the files in progs/ for example programs written in Frugal and extensions
 to Frugal's core.

If you write some decent programs in frugal, I would very much like to
include them in the progs/ directory. Please E-Mail me!
