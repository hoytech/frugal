Here are some programs and libraries for use with frugal:

The rough format is  "name - description STATUS"

STATUS can be any of these:

MATURE:
This program has been used so much that all of the obvious bugs have
long since been flushed out. This program has extensive, clear
documentation.

STABLE:
This program seems to work fine, most of the bugs should be out of the
program. The program has been documented, and is ready for use.

BETA TESTING:
This program is probably ready for use, but more testing needs to
be done before it can be consider STABLE. May not be fully documented yet.

ALPHA TESTING:
This program is mostly written, and some kind of functionality exists.
Chances are this program has many bugs, and will need quite a bit of
work before it becomes STABLE. It may have the beginnings of documentation.
 
BEING DEVELOPED:
This program is in development. Chances are that this program will NOT
have any desired functionality. This program is not guaranteed to run
or even compile. It may have tiny fragments of documentation here and there.
